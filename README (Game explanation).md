# C-Sharp-custom-addition-game
This is a game I created using C# which requires the user to add 1 random number to another random number until the user gets it wrong.
Once the user gets it wrong, it displays the final score for them to see. 
The purpose of this game is simply to exersize your brain by using potentially difficult numbers to add over and over to test your mental math.
